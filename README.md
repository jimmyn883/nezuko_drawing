# Nezuko Drawing

A procedural Python illustration of Nezuko Kamado from *Demon Slayer*, drawn using basic commands in the Python Imaging Library (PIL). What started as a simple homework assignment evolved into a passion project focused on detail, layering, and technical expression through code.

## 🎓 Project Background

This drawing originated as an assignment in **CS1112: Introduction to Programming** at the **University of Virginia**. The goal was to practice using loops, conditionals, and graphic primitives by creating a drawing of our choice.

While many opted for abstract shapes or landscapes, I wanted to push the limits — so I chose to illustrate one of my favorite anime characters and continued improving it well beyond the scope of the class. The result is a fully hand-coded rendering using only built-in drawing methods — no external assets, no tracing.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates how Python, combined with creativity and a bit of stubbornness, can be used to manually render complex characters and scenes. It uses nothing but raw shape primitives (e.g., `polygon`, `ellipse`, `rectangle`, `line`, `point`) to build a recognizable figure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `Pillow` (PIL fork)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo and install requirements:
```bash
pip install pillow
